                <p>You are encouraged to work on homework problems in study groups of two to four people; however, you must <b>always write up the solutions on your own</b>. Similarly, you may use books or online resources to help solve homework problems, but you must <b>always credit all such sources in your writeup and you must never copy material verbatim</b>. We believe that most students can distinguish between helping other students and cheating. Explaining the meaning of a question, discussing a way of approaching a solution, or collaboratively exploring how to solve a problem within your group is an interaction that we strongly encourage. But you should write your homework solution strictly by yourself so that your hands and eyes can help you internalize this material. You must explicitly acknowledge everyone whom you have worked with or who has given you any significant ideas about the homework. Not only is this good scholarly conduct, it also protects you from accusations of being a jerk or free-rider regarding your colleagues' ideas.</p>

<p>Warning: Your attention is drawn to the <a href="http://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/Policies/acad.dis.shtml">Department's Policy on Academic Dishonesty</a>. In particular, you should be aware that copying or sharing solutions, in whole or in part, from other students in the class or any other source without acknowledgment constitutes cheating. Any student found to be cheating risks automatically failing the class and being referred to the Office of Student Conduct.</p>

<p>However, we are very fair. No student will be accused of cheating without a human being looking over their case. And nobody will be sent to Student Conduct without at least the head TA and Prof concurring that this is warranted and makes sense. Algorithms help us focus our attention, but decisions are made by compassionate human beings.</p>
